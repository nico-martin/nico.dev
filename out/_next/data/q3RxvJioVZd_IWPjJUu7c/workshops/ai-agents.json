We will cover the fundamentals of LLMs, explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and learn how to use function calling to connect AI with external tools.\r\nBy the end, you will have a working AI agent that can autonomously decide which functions and data sources to use. No prior AI experience is required, but basic knowledge of TypeScript is recommended.","covers":[{"title":"Understand how Large Language Models (LLMs) work","description":"and how they process and generate text."},{"title":"Leverage LLMs for specific tasks","description":"by designing prompts and integrating them into applications."},{"title":"Implement Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)","description":"to enhance AI responses with external knowledge."},{"title":"Use function calling in AI systems","description":"to interact dynamically with APIs and data sources."},{"title":"Build an AI agent","description":"that autonomously selects the right tools and data to complete user tasks efficiently."}],"audience":"<p>No prior knowledge of Artificial Intelligence is necessary, as we’ll cover all the essential concepts during the workshop.</p>\n<p>We’ll build the AI agent in a React app, but the core logic will be framework-agnostic and written in TypeScript.</p>\n","requirements":"<p>Participants need to bring their own laptop with the following tools pre-installed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Git</li>\n<li>NPM v. 10+</li>\n<li>Node.js v. 20+</li>\n<li>An IDE of their choice</li>\n</ul>\n","facts":[{"title":"Language","description":"German or English"},{"title":"Duration","description":"1-2 Days"}],"cta":"Interested in upskilling your developers in AI?\r\nLet’s organize a workshop at your company.","image":{"sizes":{"page":{"url":"https://wp.nico.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nicodev-image-900x900.jpg","width":900,"height":900},"large":{"url":"https://wp.nico.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nicodev-image-600x600.jpg","width":600,"height":600},"medium":{"url":"https://wp.nico.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nicodev-image-320x320.jpg","width":320,"height":320},"small":{"url":"https://wp.nico.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nicodev-image-160x160.jpg","width":160,"height":160}},"placeholder":"https://wp.nico.dev/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nicodev-image-80x80.jpg","alt":"","title":"nicodev-image"},"imagePosition":"center center","publics":[{"venue":"React Paris","title":"Getting started with AI (-agents) in the browser","url":"https://react.paris/#workshops","date":"2025-03-19"},{"venue":"Uphill Conf","title":"Getting started with AI in the browser: Build an Agent with TypeScript","url":"https://www.uphillconf.com/workshops/getting-started-with-ai-in-the-browser-build-an-agent-with-typescript","date":"2025-04-24"}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
